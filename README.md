# Computer Vision Projects

## Task 1: Corner Detection
Implemented **Harris Corner Detection** to identify key points in images. 
Tested the algorithm's robustness by applying transformations such as rotation and introducing noise to a checkerboard pattern.

## Task 2: Image Similarity Detection
Applied computer vision techniques to determine image similarity using **keypoint detection** and **feature matching**. 
Implemented advanced methods such as:
- **David Lowe's Ratio Test** for robust feature matching.
- **Thresholding** and **Cross-Checking** to refine matches.
- **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** for accurate analysis of visual similarities and differences.

This project highlights proficiency in analyzing and comparing visual data, ensuring high accuracy in identifying similarities and differences between images.
